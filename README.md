### How to run

```

`mread` should now be running at `http://localhost:5678`

### Ideas
* **done** Improve gallery view (options for rtl/ltr, arrows, display which page we're on)
* Add backends for more website (Mangafox, Batoto, etc.) - lower priority, Mangaeden is quite good
* Add (client side) settings button for backend selection
* Save read progress
* Save view progress
  * Show badge for new unseen chapters
  * Could me merged with read progress - show badge for unread chapters
* Add screenshots to README
* Add stats to homepage (e.g. last update, next update, how many manga in mangaeden list)
* Add favourite button to pin to index
* go client/server???
